Description: This application enables users to upload their datasets and
    perform Non-Compartment Analysis (NCA) on both pre-clinical and
    clinical datasets, with the results being easily visualizable. The NCA
    can be tailored to calculate pharmacokinetic parameters for various
    dosing regimens and time points, given certain restrictions. It also
    features manual slope selection, simplifying the process of conducting
    lambda-z-regression and PK-timepoint exclusions.  Furthermore, the
    pharmacokinetic parameters can be dynamically visualized through
    customized graphics such as line and mean plots. The calculated
    pharmacokinetic parameters can be compiled in a dynamic table,
    visualized using boxplots, or exported as a comprehensive report.
    Designed with user-friendliness in mind, this app aims to make NCA
    accessible and straightforward for all scientists.
