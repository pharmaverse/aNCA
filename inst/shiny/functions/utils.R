#' Sets up the logger package for the application.
#'
#' @details
#' The application logs everything to a log file located in `/log` directory. If such folder
#' does not exist, it will be created. Logfile for each session will be separate. The application
#' will keep 5 log files at any given time - if this number is exceeded, the oldest log file
#' will be deleted.
#'
#' In addition, information of the level specified by the user will be logged to console.
#' As a default, this level is INFO - this is so that the user has good information on what is
#' happening inside the app, but is not overwhelmed with tracing and debugging information. This
#' level can be changed using `aNCA_LOG_LEVEL` environmental variable, set for example in
#' `.Renviron` file.

#' Needed to properly reset reactable.extras widgets
#'
#' @details
#' When the data underlying the `reactable` instance is changed (e.g. rows are deleted), and
#' the reactable is re-rendered, the `reactable.extras` widgets still hold their values. This
#' leads to incorrect display, e.g. after removing a middle row, now widgets for removed row 2
#' will be displayed over what used to be row 3. After significanlty changing the data under
#' `reactable`, the memory of `reactable.extras` needs to be reset.
