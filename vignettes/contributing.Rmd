Thank you for your interest in the aNCA application! We strive to provide open-sourced for performing Non-Compartment Analysis for both pre-clinical and clinical datasets, aiming to make NCA straightforward and approachable to all scientists.

# Report bugs and suggest enhancements
Discussions regarding the project are handled using issues system directly on GitHub. If you wish to create a bug report, suggest changes and additions, or just ask questions regarding the project feel free to open a new issue. Templates for specific topic are available, so please try to select the appropriate one and follow the guidelines as close as applicable.

In general, any posted issue should contain a brief description of the problem, as well as your expectations - we design this application with user-friendliness in mind, we wish to hear your opinion!

# Submit changes
## Joining the project
In order to gain privileges to commit changes to the codebase, you will need to be added as a collaborator. To do so, please contact one of the contributors. You can find the list with contact info in the [DESCRIPTION](/DESCRIPTION) file.

## Issues
Before creating any changes, please make sure an appropriate issue thread is opened. This is the place to discuss the topic at hand, agree on the approach for solving the problem and keep the tasks organized across the whole project.

To keep things organized, [GitHub Project board](https://github.com/orgs/pharmaverse/projects/30/views/1) is used.

#### Status
Each new issue should go to **Backlog**. Feel free to add not only any bugs and feature requests, but also loose ideas - this is also a space for discussing proposals and validity of implementing them. When committed to implementing a change, the issue is moved to `Todo` status, and subsequently to `In progress` when a feature branch is created and work has begun. When the change is ready and the pull request is open, issues should be moved to `Needs review` where it will be picked up by a reviewer and moved to `In review`. After the change is merged and issue is closed, it will be moved to `Done`.

#### Priority
The tasks are prioritized based on a variant of the [MSCW method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method). It gives a verbose descriptions for each level of priority:
- **MUST** - task of highest priority, must be implemented for the application to be usable and useful.
- **SHOULD** - task that we should include in the ready product, but it will not be breaking if it is not implemented.
- **COULD** - things that would be nice to have and useful, but not instrumental to the whole package.
- **WISH** - ideas that are not valid for the time being, but are nevertheless cool and could become useful as the development progresses.

## Branches
Each change should be implemented on a separate branch. Branches should have related issues opened and be named after the issue topic. Branch name should include change type (bug/enhancement/documentation etc.) and name of the solved issue. Examples:

| Issue                                   | Branch                                 |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Documentation: add CONTRIBUTING.md file | documentation/add-contributing-md-file |
| Bug: help widget not working            | bug/help-widget-not-working            |
|                                         |                                        |

## Code guidelines
The codebase follows the general [tidyverse](https://style.tidyverse.org/files.html) guidelines, but with lenient implementation. Please do make an effort to make your code clean, readable and easily understandable for the reviewer. In general, as long as your code passes all the `lintr` tests, you are good.

## Commit messages
Do try to follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) convention whenever possible. That said, software development is messy and if you feel like this standard does not suit the situation, feel free to deviate from it, but do keep the commit messages short and meaningful at the very least.

## Pull requests
[Pull request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) is available to make documenting PRs more consistent and streamlined. Each PR description should include:

#### Issue
Number of the appropriate issue the pull request closes or references.

#### Description
Brief description of implemented changes, what they do and what is the reasoning behind the changes. 

#### Definition of Done
Checklist with minimal requirements to consider the feature or bug fix complete. Preferably the list supplied with the appropriate issue. Requirements might change and the scope might grow or shrink during development, so feel free to make changes to the list if relevant, but make sure any deviations are documented.

#### How to test
Instructions on how to test the new feature manually (go to..., click on...). Might include code snippets. It is especially important to include such instructions if submitted code is not fully covered by unit tests. If full suite of unit tests is supplied alongside logic, this part might not be required or relevant in terms of miscellaneous changes (documentation, dependencies etc.).

#### Developers checklist
This part is here as a reminder to perform basic tasks and checks before the code is submitted, to ensure compliance with the guidelines. Before opening a PR for review, please make sure that:
- Code passes lintr checks
- Code passes all unit tests
- New logic covered is by unit tests
- New logic is documented
- Package version is bumped

The above rules will help keep our work organized, as well as allow for quick information flow between related issues, branches and pull requests.

#### Notes to reviewer
If there is anything that the reviewer should know before tackling the pull request, please provide it here. This could include things like pointing to specific parts of the code that require special attention, explaining decisions behind unusual implementations or providing logic behind changing the scope of the task.

### Bumping package version
Package versioning must use the semantic versioning schema, with development extension: **X.Y.Z.9NNN**

#### Development version
In each PR that introduces changes to the code, dependencies or the function documentation, it is required that the development package version is incremented by 1 (this is the .9NNN number, the last part of the versioning schema). As the current feature branch might be outdated, before merging please cross-check with the **main** branch that the version you are submitting is correct.

#### Semantic versioning
The versioning schema for major / minor / patch releases must adhere to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) guidelines.

## Code review
Each pull request must be accepted by at least two reviewers before it can be merged to the main branch.

#### For developer
When the change is done, pull request is open and the description is filled, please move your issue from **In Progress** to **Needs review** status, so it can be picked up by a reviewer. From this point it is up to the contributor and the person validating the change to work out any kinks and lead to merging the changes.

#### For reviewers
When reviewing a pull request, please do try to follow the [conventional comments](https://conventionalcomments.org/) guidelines. Ideas and labels described in that convention can be very helpful in getting your thoughts across and facilitate meaningful cooperation. That said, they are not applicable in every circumstance and you are free to do whatever you feel is suitable, as long as it aims to provide valid discussion.

# Beware
- The package is split into two parts: the R package and a shiny application. Logic code, which is useful on its own and can be easily run via the console should be placed in the `R/` directory. Code that is strictly related to **Shiny** application, especially code that generates some interface elements, should be placed in `inst/shiny/` folder. 
- The package requires some dependencies for which there are no explicit `@import` statements in the `NAMESPACE` file. This is because some of those functions are not used in the **package** itself, but rather in the **Shiny application**. Please beware of this situation when managing the package dependencies - some functions might be used in the app, even though they are not verbosely imported.
- For development purposes, you can specify a log level using `aNCA_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable. As a default, this is set to **INFO**. We recommend setting the log level to **TRACE**, e.g. in your `.Renviron` file (`aNCA_LOG_LEVEL="TRACE"`).
