This guide will provide users with information on how to get started with the aNCA app.

# Step 1: Prepare Dataset

### Uploading a dataset

Click **Upload File** and select the dataset you would like to use. The data can be in `.csv`, `sas7bdat`, `.xslx`, `.parquet` or `.rds` format. The best input for the app is data that follows the ADNCA format according to CDISC guidelines. Other formats of data will also work. Alternatively, for exploring the app, Users can use the Dummy dataset that is already uploaded.

-   Click **Next** to get to the *Preview* section where you can review your dataset.

<img src="images/get_started/GIFs/DataMapping.gif" alt="Mapping"/ /width="100%"> 

### Preview

Review the data to ensure that the columns have been mapped correctly, and that all of your filters have been applied. If there are any problems with your data (duplicates, missing times), the application will display a warning message and in certain situations manual edits will be requested. Just follow the instructions. The 'Exploration', 'NCA' and 'TLG' tabs on the left should now be accessible.

# Step 2: Exploratory Analysis

In the *Exploration* tab, you will find the different visualization options, including individual plots and mean plots. Here, you can check out your data to see if the profiles and subjects look good, and use the selection boxes on the right to toggle the formatting and other aspects of them. Once you've made your choices you can download, save and inspect the visualizations in the top right corner of the plot.

# Step 3: Run NCA

Click on the *NCA* tab in the menu bar to switch to the next section.

## Setup - Data Selection

1.  *Settings*: Choose the Analyte, Dose Number(s) and/or Specimen(s) you would like to run the NCA on, the extrapolation method and the NCA parameters to calculate. Select additional options including partial AUCs, units, or rule sets to flag the data at the bottom of this tab.  You can also download the settings you have created, and upload them again the next time you use the app, which will implement the saved setup. Note, only settings downloaded from the app can be uploaded here.

<img src="images/get_started/GIFs/DownloadSettingsNCA.gif" alt="NCA settings"/ width="100%">

*Slope Selector*: To add exclusions or manual slope selections, go to the *Slope Selector* tab in the *Setup* page. There are two different ways to add exclusions/selections to the slopes.

#### Via the Buttons

1.  For selection and exclusion, click **+ Exclusion/Selection** and input the corresponding information. RANGE refers to the data point number in the slope, which can be seen by hovering over the points in the plots below.
2.  To remove, select the sample row and click **- Remove selected rows**.

#### Via the Plots

For in-app guidance, you can click the [?]{.help-button} button.

<img src="images/get_started/GIFs/NCASetupSlopeSelector.gif" alt="NCA settings"/ width="100%">

1.  For selection, click the first point and then the last point you want included in the slope. The plot should then update and a row should be added to the table. There you can add your reason for selection.
2.  For exclusion, double click the point you want to exclude. The plot should update along with the table.
3.  To remove, either remove via the table selection, or repeat the same action (i.e. select a new slope, double click the same point).

*Summary*: In this tab, a table summarizes the settings you have selected.

2.  Click **Run NCA** at the top of the page and check that the data is as expected. You will automatically be redirected to the *Results* tab.

# Step 4: NCA Results

## Main Results

The *NCA Results* tab shows the individual results of the NCA. You can select which parameters you would like to view. Results in red have been flagged as "FALSE" for the rule sets selected, results in purple are flagged as "MISSING", and results in white are not flagged. Here, you have the option to download all of the results and just the NCA data, this is found at the bottom of the page.

<img src="images/get_started/GIFs/NCAResultsDownload.gif" alt="NCA settings"/ width="100%">

## Slopes Information - Exclusions and Manual Slopes after NCA

You may also choose to add some exclusions or manual slope selections after the NCA has been run if you wish, this up to you. Just go back to the *Setup* tab and follow the instructions above about the *Slope Selector* in Step 3. Once the exclusions/selections have been added, click **Run NCA** again.

<blockquote class="important">

If you do not click **Run NCA**, the manual slopes will not be added!

</blockquote>

Back in the *Results* tab, click on the *Slopes Information* tab to view more detailed information about the slopes selected in the NCA. This is also where you can check that your slope modifications have been applied in the *Manual Adjustments* tab.

## Descriptive Statistics

The *Descriptive Statistics* tab allows you to see the statistical data calculated by the NCA. This includes mean, SD, min, max and others, you can choose which statistics and parameters you wish to display in your summary table. You can also choose which variables you want to group by. After you have selected your preferences, you can scroll down and press *Download NCA Summary Data* to download this summary table.

### Parameter Datasets

In the Parameter Datasets tab you can see and export the ADPP, ADPC, and PP datasets.

<img src="images/get_started/GIFs/ParameterDatasets.gif" alt="Parameter Datasets"/ width="100%">


## Additional Analysis

In the *Additional Analysis* tab, you can calculate tissue-matrix ratios and perform excretion analysis where applicable.

*Concentration Ratios*: You can calculate tissue-matrix ratios in this tab. Input which specimen you would like as the numerator and denominator, and you can choose what variable you would like to summarize this data by. This will generate a matrix ratios results table which you can download.

# Step 5: TLGs

<blockquote class="warning">

Currently work in progress. Not all TLGs and features are available.

</blockquote>

After performing the analysis, you can prepare reports regarding the analysis, including various tables, listings and graphs.

### Order Details

Firstly, you will need to prepare an order for TLGs. The table in the *Order details* tab will display some default TLGs with their metadata. You can add additional reports by clicking the **Add TLG** button. This will bring up a list of available, defined TLGs. Select the ones you are interested in and click the **Add TLGs to Order** button. You can also remove unwanted entries by selecting them and clicking **Remove TLG**.

When you are happy with the selection, click **Submit Order Details**.

<img src="images/get_started/GIFs/TLGSelection.gif" alt="Default TLG table"/ width="100%">

### Navigating the TLGs

The application provides three separate tabs for differentiating **Tables**, **Listings** and **Graphs**, these are found at the top.

Each tab will show a sidebar on the left of the screen. This will let you navigate each specific entry.

<img src="images/get_started/GIFs/TLGsSidebar.gif" alt="TLG navigation"/ width="100%">

Also, in each tab using the widgets at the top you can specify the number of entries per page and change the pages.

<img src="images/get_started/GIFs/TLGsWidgetsatTop.gif" alt="TLG pages"/ width="100%">

Lastly, the widgets on the right are used for customizing the resulting reports.

<img src="images/get_started/GIFs/TLGsCustomisingReports.gif" alt="TLG customization"/ width="100%">

### Customizing the TLGs

Exact customization options available for any given TLGs will depend on their implementation. Usually, you will be able to specify things like titles and footnotes, axis labels, limits or grouping variables.

Simply provide the desired value in a given widget and the TLG will update in real time.

Leaving a widget empty will induce default behavior of the TLG.

Some fields will provide additional functionalities. For text fields, a special syntax might be used to reference the values or attributes of the data:

-   prefacing a column name with `!` will reference the **label attribute** of a given column, e.g. `!DOSEU` will translate to `Treatment Dose Units`.
-   prefacing a column name with `$` will reference the **value** for a given column, e.g. `$DOSEU` will translate to mg (for the dummy dataset).

You can always click on the [?]{.help-button} button for help.
