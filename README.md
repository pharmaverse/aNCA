<br/> 

> Our aim is to develop and share an open-source R Shiny application for performing Non-Compartmental Analysis (NCA) on clinical and non-clinical datasets worldwide and across pharmaceutical companies. 

<br/> 

## Description

This application enables users to upload their datasets and perform Non-Compartment Analysis (NCA) on both pre-clinical and clinical datasets, with the results being easily visualizable. Designed with user-friendliness in mind, this app aims to make NCA accessible and straightforward for all scientists. Among the features it currently possess, the App can:

* **Customize half life calculation**: Either by rule settings definitions or performing manual in-plot adjustments
* **Define AUC intervals of interest**: Providing by default last and to-infinite calculations 
* **Visualize data and results** with interactive boxplots, summary statistic tables and scatter plots
* **Produce PP and ADPP** dataset formats of the resulting parameters
* **Save your analysis settings** and reupload them later to keep on analysing!

## Installation
To install the application, clone the repository and load it locally using the following commands in your terminal:
``` sh
git clone https://github.com/pharmaverse/aNCA.git # Clone the repository
```
You can then run the application from the R console anytime. Just make sure first your working directory is set to the aNCA folder:
``` r
# install devtools if not present
if (!requireNamespace('devtools', quietly = TRUE)) install.packages('devtools')
devtools::load_all() # load all dependencies
aNCA::run_app() # run the application
```

## Quick start
The testing data will be automatically loaded upon application startup. You can provide your own dataset in the **data** tab. Here you can also specify pre-processing filters.

In the **NCA** tab, start off by loading the pre-processed data using *Submit* button. You will also need to choose dose number in the *Settings*. Then, you will be able to run the NCA analysis. From there, you can also specify different analysis options, like applying flag rule sets and selecting slopes.

After the setup is done and analysis is performed, you are free to explore the results in the **Outputs** tab. Application supports various customizable plots, as well as report exporting.

For more detailed instructions, you can find a pdf guide [here](docs/aNCA-User-Guide.pdf) in the docs folder.
